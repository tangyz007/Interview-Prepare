I'm just going to be sharing behavioral interview questions because they're less revealing but also because no one ever shares them but always give generic "prep LP" advice. So I hope you guys find this useful. These are the actual questions I was asked.

Phone interview (1 hour):
2x behavioral interview questions + 2 coding questions

Onsite 5 rounds (~50 min each):

2x behavioral interview questions + technical portion Maybe 35/65 time split (4 rounds)
5x behavioral interview questions. All behavioral (1 round)

Total of ~15 behavioral questiond asked, but I forgot one.

In no particular order:

Tell me a time when you...

Disagreed with your team’s decision but you went along with it.
Took a risk and failed.
Improved some sort of process for your company and/or customer [x2]
recognized gaps in your own knowledge and what did you do to fix that
took on work that wasn’t assigned to you
identified an issue that everyone else overlooked
disagreed with management
had to deal with ambiguity
had to solve a tough problem, how did you identify the root cause and how did you solve it
What was the most interesting problem you’ve worked on?
worked on something that you weren’t familiar with
exceeded a customer’s expectations
worked on something but the project pivoted in a way.

Thoughts:
Really do prep your anwsers. I personally had a 13 pages long google doc of prepped answers. I reused multiple "projects" or "scenarios" but worded them differently so that they can be used to answer different questions.

The technical portions I was asked a system design question and some LC meds.
