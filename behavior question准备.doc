Focus communication, don't go too one sided.

a. 你有没有遇到过deadline来不及的情况，你怎么解决的。 Many many times, we have all been through colleges. And worse, in my startup, deadlines can always be hard to make. Don't panic when such situation happens, organize a list of goals all the way to the final goal, make reasonable expectations. Evaluate what might happen if you cannot reach some goals. If there is something hard to handle, talk to your supervisor. Ask for help. Let your boss know before it happens. Work hard, leave perfectionism and reach as many goals as you can. But at the same time, don't lose your patience.

Make sure DELIVER RESULTS. Even the not perfect one.

b. 你发现你组里一个组员的任务实际上来不及赶上deadline了，你懂他 负责的这块，他可能没有你懂，却以为来得及。你们的老板不清楚情 况，你该怎么做。

I will first try to comminicate with this guy, try to understand his plan and evaluate with him together about the feasibilities. It's very possible that he has more experience and insight in his job rather than me. Then I will try to look about things I can give a hand. If that is all done and I still think he's not on the right track and I might consider talk about it with the boss. This is trully a risky move, it may have counter productive results, ruin personal relationships. However, if that will help to prevent a potential loss, failure of the team, I think it's still worth the risk.

c. 你想用A方法来实现你负责的这块任务，你老板让你用B方法，但你觉 得其实A方法更好，你怎么办。

I will try to convince my boss about it. List all the reasons I have in hand. If there is some substantial difference, I believe the boss will take the advice. However, if it's just some personal preference of getting the job done, and I should fail convince the boss, I will just stick to the plan. If there is time constraint, make sure delivery first. Then talk about it later. Lead discussion about the issue. If you really owns it and think it right, make you decisino

Bias for action Onwership for the decision Fore-see the risk

d. 你遇到一个问题，有方案A和方案B，必须选一个。它们互有利弊。你 时间有限，无法花太多时间考虑，你应该怎么做。 诸如此类的还有不 少，不记得了。

I will set a hard time limit for myself. And before that time, I will make a decision no matter what information I have. I will get a collegue to discuss about it, any information from outside would be helpful, talking about the choice to my manager might also be a good idea. If at all last there is still no tie breaker, randomly choose one and stick to it should do no harm.

Always make sure you deliver.

Confirm that your way actually works better. Make sure you deliver results.

想起来一些manager问的问题。列举你最近6个月看过的技术方面的书。你 常看的技术blog，常去的讨论技术的网站。

Answer behavioral questions with real instance in your career. Don't go back with your emotions back then Tell your relations with that decision you made or the thing you did. What you learn from the experience.

If you can fore-see some results,
